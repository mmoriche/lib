%
% All the Euler angles used in this package assume the sequence ZYX, therefore
% the array of Euler angles is (yaw,pitch,roll).
%
% Regarding the quaternions the order is qx,qy,qz,qw
%
% The rotation matrix is defined as the matrix that transform the coordinates
% in the fixed reference frame into the body reference frame.
%
% Therefore is the tranpose of the matrix given by the Robotics toolbox from
% Matlab.
